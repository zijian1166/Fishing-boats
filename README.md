# Fishing-boats
This is a project of a nest and net boat using ESP32 as the main controller. The design, manufacture and manual mode testing of the 10A motor driver power system have been completed. The control range is 1KM radius and the boat speed is 3m/s. The next step is expected to add GPS automatic homing and Angle closed-loop control functions to further improve the stability and accuracy of the system.

The ESP32 code has been uploaded, and the PCB schematic and circuit design drawings will be uploaded later.
